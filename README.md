# AV Designer

An automated audio/visual design system for professional AV integrators. This platform streamlines the design process by evaluating designs against custom standards, automating room builds, and generating comprehensive documentation.

## Features

### Design Standards Engine
- Evaluate AV designs against custom, configurable design standards
- Create and maintain organization-specific design rules
- Automated compliance checking and recommendations
- Flag design inefficiencies and suggest optimizations

### Room Builder
- Quickly build and configure AV rooms with an intuitive interface
- Drag-and-drop equipment placement
- Real-time equipment quoting and BOM generation
- Support for common room types (conference rooms, classrooms, auditoriums, etc.)

### Documentation Generation
- **Electrical Line Drawings**: Auto-generate equipment electrical connection diagrams
- **Room Elevations**: Create 2D elevation views showing equipment placement
- **Equipment Schedules**: Detailed lists with model numbers, quantities, and specifications

### 3D Visualization
- Render customer rooms in 3D with equipment placement
- Microphone pickup pattern visualization
- Speaker coverage and distribution pattern overlays
- Identify coverage gaps and design inefficiencies
- Client-ready presentation views

### Analysis Tools
- Microphone coverage analysis
- Speaker SPL distribution modeling
- Display viewing angle and distance calculations
- Cable length estimation
- Power consumption totals
